              <h4><strong>IS MY PANEL SAFE?</strong></h4>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-indent: 40px">
                  Today, there are panels that may have major manufacturing and/or design flaws that potentially put homeowners at risk—Federal Pacific Electric panels and certain Zinsco panels in particular. Also half of Americas homes were built before 1970. If your home was built anytime up until the 1980s you probably have an either outdated panel or a faulty one. Today’s society depends more than ever on electricity. Everything seems to be electronic. It’s extremely prevalent in homes now. Most people have at least one or more computers, tablets, gaming systems, several televisions, a stereo system, cell phones, security systems, and the list continues. All of these devices require electricity to function. If your home was built before 1970 it probably only has a 60 amp service and because of our demands today homes should have 200 amps. These facts point to a problem—older homes, unless their electrical system has been upgraded, are being overburdened. These outdated electric systems and panels cannot safely handle the demands of today’s society.Federal Pacific Electric Panels Potentially Could Fail to Provide Proper Safety and Protection for Homes Federal Pacific Electric Company (FPE) was one of the most common manufacturers of circuit breaker panels in North America from the 1950s to the 1980s. Millions of their panels were installed in homes across the country. Yet, as the years passed, electricians and home inspectors often found Federal Pacific Electric panels failed to provide proper protection to homeowners and their families. Experts now say that FPE panels can appear to work fine for years, but after one overcurrent or short circuit, they can overheat and become fire hazards. In a class action lawsuit, a New Jersey State Court ruled that the Federal Pacific Electric (FPE) Company “violated the Consumer Fraud Act because FPE knowingly and purposefully distributed circuit breakers which were not tested to meet UL standards…” (To see the Class Action Settlement Notice issued for New Jersey Residents, click here.) An expert who investigated the potential hazards of Federal Pacific Electric panels stated under UL 489 test conditions, that FPE panels fail to trip at a much higher rate than standard panels.</p>
                  <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-indent: 40px">
                  When a breaker fails to trip, an extreme amount of power from the outside electrical supply surges into a home’s panel and circuits. Once that happens, it cannot be stopped or shut off manually. Electricity will burn until it runs out of fuel or the wires melt. The panel could overheat and catch fire, causing serious harm to a home and its occupants. Many Federal Pacific Electric panels and breakers can operate properly for years. But if and when they do malfunction, a disaster could occur.</p>

                  What Should a Homeowner Do?
                  We Can Help!
                  The circuit breaker panel is one of the most important parts of a home’s electrical system. It constantly distributes and receives electricity. The panel protects homes from power surges and other possible hazards. With regular maintenance by a licensed electrician, experts say that today’s electrical panels can function properly and protect homes for 30 years or more.</p>
                  <p style="margin-left: 40px; text-indent: 40px"> If you suspect that you may have a Federal Pacific Electric, Zinsco, or an outdated circuit breaker panel in your home, or in any event, you have not had your panel inspected recently, you owe it to yourself and your family to contact us. Please feel free to call us and we will schedule a 100% free in home safety analysis. </p>
